This Guidance Note forms part of a series of notes offering guidance to UK pension schemes on
principles for adjusting benefits earned in the period 17 May 1990 to 5 April 1997 to correct for
the inequalities of GMPs. The High Court's decision in the Lloyds Bank case requires schemes
to equalise benefits and approved a range of methods that could be adopted. However, given
the complexity of the subject the Lloyds Bank case could not deal with all issues that can arise
in an equalisation project.
Most schemes will want to implement equalisation projects as soon as reasonably practicable
and this Guidance Note has been prepared to help them do so in a practical and pragmatic
way. It suggests ‘good practice’ approaches to deal with a number of common issues not
addressed by the High Court.
This Guidance Note is not a definitive guide to the issues nor is it a substitute for professional
advice. It has been assumed:
• Readers will have a working knowledge of GMPs and why they can produce unequal
benefits between male and female members.
• Readers will be familiar with guidance issued by the Department for Work and Pensions1
on how GMP conversion may be used as part of an equalisation project.
It is recommended employers and trustees work collaboratively involving scheme
administrators and advisers as appropriate.
It is intended to update this Guidance Note to reflect changes to the law, official guidance or
industry practice. This version is based on current understanding of the law, guidance and
practice as at September 2019.
Separate Guidance Notes will be published by the GMP Equalisation Working Group to cover:
• Data issues
• Impacted Transactions
• Tax issues
• Reconciliation and Rectification of GMPs
All of the Guidance Notes together with the GMP Equalisation Working Group's Call to Action are
available on-line at www.pasa-uk.com.

1. Introduction
1.1. The Lloyds Bank case and unanswered issues
Since the Lloyds Bank judgment was issued in October 2018 schemes which were contracted out
have known they need to equalise for the effects of GMPs. Whilst the judgment approved some
methods for schemes to achieve equality, a number of ancillary issues arising in implementing an
equalisation project remain unresolved. The complexity and cost of going to court, coupled with
the modest financial impact for most members, means these ancillary issues may never be subject
to judicial scrutiny and therefore could remain unanswered by the Courts.
When schemes take steps to equalise benefits for the effects of GMPs they will need to address
many of these unanswered issues. To assist, this Guidance Note sets out suggested approaches
schemes may wish to adopt to address common unanswered issues.
In preparing this Guidance Note the GMP Equalisation Working Group has deliberately adopted a
proportionate and pragmatic approach – suggesting approaches which are considered to be ‘good
practice’ for schemes to adopt.
1.2. GMP Equality
The aim of a GMP equalisation project is to make sure a member with a GMP relating to contracted
out pensionable service during the period 17 May 1990 to 05 April 1997 receives benefits which are
not less than those that would have been provided had the member been of the opposite sex during
this period. In this Guidance Note this is referred to as achieving ‘GMP Equality’.
Whilst achieving GMP Equality sounds simple, in practice there may be complexities caused by:
• The requirements of legislation governing GMPs and making them inherently unequal as
between the sexes.
• Missing or incomplete data.
• The need to identify that part of each member's benefit relating to the period 17 May 1990
to 05 April 1997 (both GMP and excess) and to construct those benefits that would be
payable to an opposite sex comparator in respect of this period.
• Individual scheme benefit structures and how they treat members' GMPs and benefits in
excess of GMP.
• Potential tax implications.
It is recognised schemes may feel a sense of frustration at having to incur additional administration
and adviser costs to make what will be, for most members, relatively modest changes to the value
of benefits. The prime aim of the GMP Equalisation Working Group is to help schemes achieve GMP
Equality in a cost efficient and pragmatic way, in compliance with known legal requirements.

1.3. Future Developments
The High Court is still to hear a further instalment in the Lloyds Bank case which will consider how
to treat transferred out benefits for GMP Equality purposes. HMRC is understood to be preparing
guidance on how adjustments to benefits arising as part of an equalisation project should be treated
for pension tax purposes.
It is expected most schemes will choose to wait for the publication of HMRC guidance before
implementing an equalisation project. However, there may be some schemes, such as those in
winding up, which will need to achieve GMP Equality before then.
Even though it may be some time before schemes can achieve GMP Equality, schemes should start
to prepare and consider taking the steps referred to in the GMP Equalisation Working Group's Call
to Action2.
The intention is to issue updated versions of this Guidance Note as and when there are material
developments.
1.4. Data and tax implications – separate Guidance Notes
Achieving GMP Equality will require schemes to recalculate benefits already paid over periods
potentially spanning 30 years. This raises significant issues around the availability of data. As
mentioned, a separate Guidance Note will be published by the GMP Equalisation Working Group
providing guidance to schemes on how to address these issues.
Adjustments to benefits to achieve GMP Equality and the payment of arrears of past
underpayments, whilst modest in most cases, may create tax implications which, again, will be the
subject of a separate Guidance Note by the GMP Equalisation Working Group and, it is understood,
HMRC guidance.
1.5. Member communication and engagement
GMP equalisation is a detailed subject. Whilst it is likely few members will wish to engage in the
detail, schemes should pay attention to communications with their members. Members will need
to understand the impact of any changes to their benefits and be given confidence adjustments
have been correctly made.
A number of schemes have already issued interim communications to members to inform them:
• The scheme is considering the implications of the Lloyds Bank case and will decide, in due
course, how GMP Equality is to be achieved.
• Not all members' benefits will be affected by GMP Equality and for those who are, in most
cases, any increase is likely to be modest.

## Page 9

As mentioned below, there is a possibility in some (perhaps rare) cases, depending on the method
used to achieve GMP Equality, a member's pension in payment could be reduced - although were
this to be the case the member will receive an arrears payment for past inequalities.
If GMP Equality is to be achieved using a year by year3 approach schemes may wish to consider
implementing any changes as part of the annual pension increase, communicating to members at
that time (explaining the scheme has achieved GMP Equality and giving details of any revision to
the member's pension as a result). Some schemes may for operational or other reasons decide to
implement GMP Equality changes outside of the annual increase.
Where GMP Equality is to be achieved using the statutory conversion process it is necessary to
consult with the affected members before conversion. The level of consultation (and resulting
member engagement) is likely to vary depending on the extent to which members' benefits are to
be reshaped as part of the conversion process.
1.6. Worked examples
Worked examples are included in the Appendix to this Guidance Note. These have been designed
to demonstrate how GMP Equality might be achieved using different methods and how past
underpayments could be calculated.
All of the worked examples use the same individual member (called ‘Mark’) who is a male born on
30 July 1944. Mark joined the scheme on 01 January 1978 and left on 01 January 2000. His deferred
pension at the date of leaving was £17,500 (inclusive of a GMP, pre and post 88, of £3,792.36). Mark's
scheme revalues GMPs at the fixed rate and excess on the statutory basis. Pensions in excess of
GMPs are increased in payment in line with RPI capped at 5% pa and GMPs in payment are increased
as required by legislation.
The worked examples illustrate the various ways in which Mark's benefits could be adjusted either
using year by year approaches or by using GMP conversion to achieve equality. In one case
(retirement from deferred status at 62 unreduced) Mark is disadvantaged and would receive arrears
and an uplift. However, in another case (retirement from active at 55) Mark would be advantaged
overall compared to his Comparator4.
Further worked examples may be issued with updates to this Guidance Note.
1.7. Sections of this Guidance Note
The remainder of the Guidance Note is divided into the following sections:
Section A – Correcting past underpayments
Section B – Approaches for equalising future benefit payments
Section C – Common unanswered issues

2. Section A – Correcting Past Underpayments
2.1. Introduction
Prior to the Lloyds Bank case very few schemes adjusted benefits to achieve GMP Equality. This
was mainly because until the judgment, schemes were not certain equality was required and, if so,
how it should be achieved. Schemes winding up would sometimes make adjustments to address
GMP inequalities although much would depend on the funding position and status of the sponsor.
In 2011, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) adopted a method to equalise PPF compensation to
reflect past GMP inequalities.
It is now clear schemes need to adjust benefits to achieve GMP Equality and this has been a
requirement since the European Court's decision in the Barber case of 17 May 1990 (but only in
respect of benefits earned after this date). This is subject to any applicable limitation period (see
below).
The extent to which inequalities in GMPs produce unequal pension benefits will depend on a
number of factors, including the specific benefit design of the scheme and the individual
circumstances of each member. For example, there is unlikely to be any inequality for a member
retiring from pensionable service at age 60 in a scheme providing the same pension increases on
the whole pension (including the GMP). However, the member may have been treated unequally if
there was a period of deferment before the pension came into payment, because of the way GMPs
are revalued. In contrast, a scheme providing different increases to GMPs and excess benefits will
likely produce inequality even for those who retire at normal retirement age (NRA).
All schemes undertaking an equalisation project need to review past payments and correct
underpayments where necessary. This review of past payments requires a year by year approach
to be adopted5 for all benefits which have been paid to or in respect of all members with periods of
pensionable service between 17 May 1990 and 05 April 1997 (when GMPs ceased to accrue in
contracted out schemes). Where a member's Comparator would have received a higher benefit
then a correction payment (with interest) will be due.
2.2. Year by year approach
The year by year approach, which must be used to correct for the past, broadly requires schemes
to operate a shadow pension record tracking the pension the member received against the pension
the member's Comparator would have received. To create the shadow record it is necessary to go
back to at least the date the member left pensionable service and then track forward comparing
the benefit actually paid with the benefit which would have been paid had the member been of the
opposite sex during the period 17 May 1990 to 5 April 1997.
The Court approved three different year by year approaches (referred to in the judgment as
Methods B, C1 and C2). Method B compares the pension the member received each year against
5 It is not possible to equalise past underpayments using the statutory GMP conversion legislation

the Comparator, with the member receiving the higher of the two. Method C1 is a cumulative
method and produces a lower amount of past underpayment to Method B where the member has
been a ‘Crossover’ member (moving from advantaged to disadvantaged over the period of
retirement – or vice versa). Under Method C1, whilst the member is advantaged, a credit is built up
reflecting the higher benefit than that payable to the Comparator. When the member becomes
disadvantaged in relation to the Comparator this credit unwinds and only when it has been fully
used up does the member's pension step up to that of the Comparator6. Method C2 is similar to C1
but interest is applied to the credit7.
2.3. Which year by year method
Schemes will need to decide on the year by year method to be used to correct past
underpayments. It is expected the decision will be made in conjunction with the employer8. A
number of factors may be relevant, including:
• Impact on scheme liabilities – this will depend on the benefit structure of the scheme and
the proportion of Crossover members.
• The number of members affected – for example, if there are no Crossover members in the
scheme there should be no difference for members between the three Methods.
• Administration costs - Cumulative methods (such as C1 and C2) involve more complex
administration and are likely to be more costly to implement.
• Ease of member communication.
2.4. Illustration of methods – crossover members
Not all members will be Crossover members. Much depends on factors which are both scheme
and member specific (such as age at retirement, period of deferment and pension increase rates).
The charts below illustrate how the different year by year Methods (B and C1/2) would apply to a
Crossover member.
The first chart shows the benefit the member (red line) would receive without any GMP Equality
and compares it with the pension payable to the Comparator (green line). This shows the member
is initially disadvantaged but then becomes advantaged at a later date.
6 Where there is a forfeiture rule (see below) credits for past periods have to be restricted to the forfeiture period
7 Interest should be at the same rate as is applied to compensate for past underpayments (see below)
8 Method C2 is the only one available without employer approval
6 |


## Page 12

This second chart shows how Method B would operate. The member would receive benefits
calculated according to the dotted line – starting off on the higher (green) level and then reverting
to the (dotted) red line at the point of crossover.
A cumulative approach (Method C1/2) is illustrated in the next chart. The member's pension would
again be adjusted to follow the dotted line – so would be higher initially. However, the pension
does not step up until later – once the credit for earlier higher payments has been used up. Once
the credit has expired (with interest under Method C2) the pension would revert to the member's
(advantaged) level.
7 |


## Page 13

An issue arises for schemes adopting a cumulative Method where GMP Equality is implemented
after a Crossover member has moved from disadvantaged to advantaged status. In some cases,
the member will be entitled to a payment for past arrears9 but the member's pension in payment
needs to be reduced to that of the Comparator's. For example, if GMP Equality is implemented for
the member in the chart above at point X, he would be entitled to arrears for past underpayments
(net) but then his pension should be reduced down from the solid red line to the dotted green line.
In practice, the level of the reduction may be modest and might be covered by a normal annual
increase to the member's pension (assuming GMP Equality is implemented to coincide with annual
increases). Schemes wishing to cushion any reduction by freezing the pension at current levels
should seek advice as to whether this might itself create discrimination issues.
Where GMP conversion is used to achieve GMP Equality, legislation does not permit the pension in
payment to be reduced. This is covered further in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
guidance10 which suggests the Actuary may take into account arrears paid to the member when
assessing the actuarial value of any uplift required for GMP equalisation.
2.5. The Comparator
Equality laws require a comparator (in this case of the opposite sex to the member) is used to
determine whether there has been any unlawful discrimination. The parties in the Lloyds Bank case
agreed there was no need for an actual opposite sex comparator for GMP Equality purposes so the
Court did not decide whether this is necessary.
In reality, it is very unlikely there would be an actual opposite sex comparator to any member of a
scheme, regardless of its size. This is because an actual, real life, comparator would need to be of
the opposite sex and to have (amongst other things) the same date of birth, the same
joining/leaving dates and an identical earning history to the member.
Given the lack of any real actual opposite sex comparators, to achieve GMP Equality, schemes will
need to create hypothetical opposite sex comparators for each member and compare the benefit
the member accrued in the period 17 May 1990 to 05 April 1997 (both GMP and excess) against the
GMP and excess the member would have enjoyed had they been of the opposite sex. In this
Guidance Note the hypothetical opposite sex comparator is referred to as the "Comparator".
When considering the Comparator for a pensioner member it should be assumed the Comparator
would have exercised the same options (e.g. early retirement, commutation etc.) as the actual
member, even where this may not have been possible for the Comparator at the relevant time.
In the rare case of a scheme which has only ever had members of one sex the trustees should seek
specific legal advice as to whether there is a need to equalise for the effects of GMPs. It is
understood the DWP considers there is no need for a Comparator given the European Court's
decision in the Allonby Case.

forfeiture period in the scheme rules

2.6. Membership Categories
When addressing past underpayments schemes will need to consider the following categories of
members:
a) Pensioners in receipt of benefits who have only ever been advantaged compared to their
opposite sex Comparator. No correction of past payments is needed for this category.
b) Pensioners in receipt of benefits who have always been disadvantaged and require a
correction.
c) Pensioners who have crossed over from being disadvantaged to advantaged (or vice versa).
The calculation of past underpayments will depend on whether the scheme adopts a
cumulative approach.
d) Survivors11 in receipt of benefits following the death of a member (whether active, deferred
or pensioner) – they may or may not have been disadvantaged in the past (and the
deceased member may too have been disadvantaged if they died in retirement).
e) Former members who took a transfer value from the scheme or whose benefits were
secured by an individual annuity in the name of the member.
f) Other ‘No Further Liability Cases’ where the scheme has finished paying any benefits such
as following:
• payment of trivial lump sums;
• the death of a member/survivor with no further benefits payable; and
• payment of serious ill health lump sums where no survivors' pension is payable.
There will be no need to consider deferred or active members for underpayments as their benefits
have not yet come into payment. They however will need to be considered for equalisation going
forward (see Section B).
2.7. De Minimis cases
There will be a cost associated with identifying each person in these categories and in calculating
whether they have been disadvantaged. Not all cases will require a correction payment as the
member may always have been advantaged. For a significant proportion of those cases requiring
correction the amounts will be modest. This raises two issues, namely:
• Can schemes choose not to make any adjustment to a member's benefit if it is considered
the adjustment is below an agreed tolerance level (referred to as de minimis cases)?
• Do schemes need to review all No Further Liability cases?
It is suggested schemes will not want to adopt any de minimis tolerance levels where a benefit is
currently in payment. The rationale for this is:
11 Survivors include children and financial dependants even though their benefits do not include a GMP element
9 |


## Page 15

• To determine whether a member is disadvantaged and if so whether the benefit is within
the tolerance level will typically require most of the administrative work to take place. There
is unlikely to be any significant cost saving for schemes in not proceeding to adjust the
member's benefit.
• Having calculated the adjustment, the cost of putting the corrected benefit into payment
should be minimal and could be part of the next annual pension increase exercise (together
with a one off lump sum for past payment).
It is recognised some schemes may wish to apply de minimis levels. If they do, they should take
advice.
The position for former members who transferred out and for No Further Liability cases might be
distinguished and is discussed below.
2.8. Past Transfers Out
The concern with transfers out is a member may have been entitled to a higher transfer value had
the scheme equalised for the effects of GMPs prior to calculating the transfer value. This will only
apply where the member would be in a disadvantaged category compared to their Comparator
(which may not be clear at the point of calculation).
Whether or not schemes now need to revisit those calculations (if sufficient data exists) is a matter
subject to a further Court hearing involving the Lloyds Bank schemes.
Schemes wishing to undertake a GMP Equality exercise may decide to do so for members and
survivors but not to address past transfers out until the legal position is clearer. Former members
who have transferred out are a discrete class and should not prevent or delay GMP Equality being
implemented for remaining members. After the Court has provided judgment on transfers out
further guidance will be issued.
2.9. No Further Liability cases
Not all No Further Liability cases will require an adjustment to achieve GMP Equality as the member
may have been in the advantaged category. There are also significant practical issues in dealing
with No Further Liability cases:
• Data may not exist – including the name of the former member, let alone their benefit
(split between GMP and Excess).
• Where data is available and a calculation shows the member was in a disadvantaged
category, it may prove impossible or disproportionately expensive to trace the member
or the member's estate/next of kin to pay what may be a relatively small sum.
• There could be tax complications with paying corrections, particularly in operating PAYE
where the member has died.
In addition to operating any limitation period (see below) schemes may decide not to incur costs in
trying to review and if necessary correct some or all No Further Liability cases. The decision would
10 |


## Page 16

need to be taken by the trustees (in conjunction with the employer) and would be a ‘commercial’
decision. Taking such a decision would not extinguish any GMP Equality liability in respect of the
former member because the scheme has a legal obligation to provide the correct level of benefit.
Accordingly:
• If a No Further Liability member, or their personal representatives, were to come forward
the scheme may then be required to calculate and correct any GMP inequalities, if data is
available.
• When the scheme subsequently winds up steps could be taken to cover the potential
liabilities for No Further Liability cases. It may be insurance products will become available
to give schemes comfort if claims were to arise post wind up the benefit would be covered.
Alternatively, a further cost/benefit analysis could be carried out at this point and advice
taken as to the appropriate course of action.
Schemes which decide not to review No Further Liability cases might consider sending a
communication to the last known address of the member (or, for recent deaths, the person who
informed the scheme of the death) to ask the former member or next of kin to contact the scheme
administrator. Where contact is made the scheme may decide to perform the calculation and
correct any past underpayment.
2.10. Limitation periods and Forfeiture rules
The Lloyds Bank case held there was no overriding statutory limitation period. This means unless
the scheme has a specific forfeiture rule, corrections to benefits need to be made back to the early
1990s – although see comments above about No Further Liability cases.
Where a scheme has a forfeiture rule it may limit the need to correct past underpayments, much
will depend on the precise wording of the rule. Even if there is a forfeiture rule it is still necessary
to go back to the day the member left pensionable service to recalculate the Comparator's benefits
and to calculate any past underpayment (even if back payments are limited by the rules)12.
Legal advice will need to be taken as to the effect of any forfeiture rule. The precise wording of the
rule may mean forfeiture is either automatic or is subject to a discretion (trustee or employer) or
only applies in certain circumstances (such as where a member could not be traced). Some rules
also allow for forfeited benefits to be reinstated on a discretionary basis. There may also be a
question as to whether a forfeiture rule introduced after the scheme was established was validly
introduced.
Some schemes have agreed to ‘stop the clock’ so any limitation period does not apply to periods
after the first Lloyds Bank judgment. This avoids members being adversely affected by delays in
achieving GMP Equality.
12 Where a cumulative year by year method is used for calculating past underpayments (i.e. Method C1 or C2), any payments
made before the start of a limitation period should not be used to offset payments arising thereafter
11 |


## Page 17

2.11. Interest on past underpayments
Where an underpayment is due because of GMP inequalities the scheme will need to include
interest to compensate for the delay in payment. In the Lloyds Bank case interest on past
underpayments was set at 1% over bank base rates on a ‘simple’ (rather than compounded) basis.
It is likely, unless the rules prescribe a particular interest rate, schemes will follow the approach
adopted in the Lloyds Bank case and award simple interest at 1% over bank base rates on past
underpayments13. Given bank base rates over much of the period and the modest amounts for
many members, the amounts of interest are likely to be small in most cases.
2.12. Correcting past underpayments – worked example
By way of illustration, in the first worked example (retirement from deferred at age 62), Mark's
pension at April 2020 (immediately before the scheme implements GMP Equality and the 01 May
2020 increase) would be £29,521.54 pa. His Comparator would have been in receipt of a slightly
higher pension at the same date of £29,801.91.
In this example Mark's pension came into payment in 2006 and he would be entitled to a payment
for past underpayments over those 14 years of £3,395.92, plus interest14.
Once a scheme has calculated past underpayments it will be ready to compensate members for
any past inequality and take steps to equalise pensions going forward (dealt with in the next
section).
2.13. Lack of opportunity cases
There will be cases where a member's options in the past have been restricted to ensure the benefit
paid at least covered the member's GMP at their GMP Age15 (for example prohibiting early
retirement on a reduced pension or restricting a lump sum commutation payment). In practice it
will not be possible to compensate the member for the loss of these opportunities even though
they would have been available to a Comparator.
13 The same level of interest should be applied where the scheme operates an accumulation with interest ‘C2’ year by year
approach
14 The worked example does not seek to add interest – applying interest at 1% over base rates simple is not a simple task
15 GMP Age is fixed by legislation as 60 for females and 65 for males

3. Section B – Approaches for equalising future benefit payments
3.1. Overview of methods
The High Court considered and approved two main approaches which may be used by schemes to
achieve GMP Equality for the future. These are by:
• Adopting a year by year method; or
• Converting the GMP and equalising benefits on an actuarial value basis.
There may be other methods not considered by the Court or this Guidance Note which might be
used to achieve GMP Equality16.
Section A explains how the various year by year methods operate so this Section B mainly focuses
on how schemes might achieve GMP Equality through conversion17.
3.2. Deciding on which approach to adopt
There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach. Each scheme will need to consider and decide which
approach best suits its needs. There are pros and cons with each approach. For example, there
could be higher implementation costs in running a conversion exercise but after it is completed
there should be administration and other savings compared to operating a year by year approach.
Legislation allows schemes to ‘reshape’ benefits18 as part of a GMP conversion exercise (although
pensions in payment cannot be reduced as a result of the conversion). Reshaping may allow
schemes to simplify their administration and exchange future increases for an immediate uplift to
the pension in payment (sometimes referred to as a PIE exercise). Reshaping may also lead to a
benefit structure which, in due course, is easier to insure possibly for a lower premium.
When considering which approach to apply schemes should consider the likely pension tax
consequences and how adjustments and payments of arrears would be treated. Tax will be the
subject of a separate Guidance note.
3.3. Different approaches for different member categories
Schemes may wish to apply a different GMP Equality approach to different categories of members.
For example, deferred members may have their GMPs equalised through a conversion process
while the scheme operates a year by year approach for existing pensioners.
Operating different approaches raises a possibility members might claim they have been
discriminated against based on their age. It is considered such claims, were they ever to be brought,
16 For example schemes in the public sector adopt a different approach to GMP equality
17 Conversion means that GMP requirements cease to apply to the member in their entirety, not just to that part of the GMP
accrued between 17 May 1990 and 5 April 1997
18 Views differ on whether it is possible to ‘reshape’ benefits accrued after April 1997 as part of a GMP conversion exercise.
Schemes looking to convert such benefits should take legal advice. This Guidance Note assumes reshaping is only
applicable for benefits accrued prior to April 1997 (including any accrued before April 1978)
13 |


## Page 19

should be objectively justified but legal advice should be taken if schemes wish to adopt different
approaches for different categories of members.
3.4. Lack of opportunity cases going forward
Where a scheme undertakes GMP conversion there should be no need to apply restrictions in the
future (as the GMP no longer exists) so lack of opportunity cases, such as restrictions on a member's
ability to retire early or restrictions on taking lump sums would not arise after conversion.
Schemes achieving GMP Equality through a year by year approach will need to consider adopting
a method for addressing any lack of opportunity cases which may arise in the future to avoid
discrimination between the sexes. In practice these tests should only apply where a member's
options are to be restricted and the test should be whether the restriction would still operate to the
same extent to the member's Comparator. If the restriction would not apply or would apply to a
lesser extent then schemes should decide whether to:
• Allow the member to exercise the option. This ‘levelling up’ may seem attractive but there
are situations where this could result in higher benefits being provided than are strictly
needed to equalise for the inequalities of GMPs19, with a resulting cost to the scheme.
• Restrict the member's option in accordance with the rules and also restrict members of the
opposite sex in the same way. This ‘levelling down’ may not be possible where the
members have a right under the rules or GMP legislation to the benefit – legal advice should
be taken.
3.5. Equalising through conversion
Legislation allows schemes to remove the requirement to provide GMPs by converting pre 1997
benefits into other benefits. Conversion could be described as a ‘once and done’ approach for
achieving GMP Equality, in that once the conversion and equalisation process has completed there
is no need to perform any further equalisation checks.
Further information on using GMP conversion as a means to achieving GMP Equality is contained in
The DWP's guidance. This method of conversion is sometimes referred to as Method D2 (again, the
term used in the Lloyds Bank case). This Guidance Note does not seek to repeat the guidance
given by DWP.
It is also possible to apply GMP conversion after having adopted a year by year approach (for
example conversion of the future benefits assuming a C2 adjustment would otherwise be made to
future payments). In practice it is expected most schemes wishing to equalise through conversion
will follow the DWP's Guidance and adopt Method D2.
19 This raises the questions as to whether the benefit in excess of that strictly required to equalise needs also to be provided
to members of the opposite sex
14 |


## Page 20

3.6. Sex-based actuarial factors on conversion
Equalisation through conversion should ensure a member has a benefit of at least equal actuarial
value to their Comparator. However, if a real life Comparator existed, and sex based actuarial
factors were used, the amount of pension post conversion paid to the two members who are
identical apart from their sex would be different. This is not something the Judge specifically
addressed in the Lloyds Bank case but is referred to in the Question and Answer section of the DWP
guidance.
Schemes undertaking GMP conversion should discuss with their Actuary and legal adviser whether
to adopt unisex actuarial factors for the conversion process (rather than sex-based factors).
Using unisex factors should result in equal converted pensions for the period 1990 to 1997. It is
recognised specific exemptions under the Equality Act 2010 enables schemes to use sex specific
factors.
3.7. Reshaping benefits on conversion
As mentioned above, conversion of GMPs allows for the reshaping of member benefits. The
legislation refers to amendments the trustees ‘think are necessary or desirable as a consequence
of or to facilitate, the GMP conversion.’
The level of reshaping can result in significant changes to a member's pension and future income.
In the worked example Mark's pension at 01 May 2020 (after uplifting to his Comparator's and
applying the 2020 increase) would be £30,542. Three methods of reshaping are applied to Mark's
pre 1997 pension under the first worked example with the following impact on his pension:
Method 1 – Single
Method 2 – two
No conversion Year tranche – no Method 3 –
tranches – partial
on Year escalating (of pre "Notional GMP"
escalation
97 accuals)
2020 £30,542 £37,510 £30,551 £30,542
2021 £31,304 £37,625 £31,307 £31,304
2022 £32,088 £37,743 £32,086 £32,088
2023 £32,894 £37,864 £32,888 £32,894
2024 £33,724 £37,989 £33,714 £33,724
It is suggested trustees might want to approach a GMP conversion exercise from the starting point
of minimal interference to the shape of members' benefits but might agree to further reshaping if
they consider it to be in the interests of their membership as a whole. Schemes should also consider
how they would consult and communicate with members on proposals to reshape benefits.

3.8. Converting active and deferred members
As inequality does not arise until benefits come into payment schemes may decide not to convert
the GMPs of active or deferred members until benefits come into payment. At this point some of
the uncertainty relating to the effect of any GMP future inequality, such as future rates of revaluation
will have been removed. Similarly, the conversion calculation can be based on the member's
selected options (eg early retirement and lump sum commutation) – rather than making future
assumptions about member choices at retirement. This is particularly true in the case of active
members where assumptions need to be made as to when the member may leave pensionable
service and this assumption can have a significant effect on the value of the member's benefit.
There is nothing in the GMP conversion legislation preventing schemes from carrying out individual
member GMP conversion exercises, for example when a member's pension comes into payment.
However, logistically, given current legislation20, it is likely to be more efficient to undertake
conversion as a bulk exercise or in batches, rather than as and when members retire. It may be
practice develops in this area.
3.9. Employer consent
The conversion legislation requires the consent of the ‘employer’ to GMP conversion. However, the
definition of employer used in the GMP conversion legislation does not fit well with schemes,
particularly those which no longer have any active members or where an employer has ceased to
participate in a multi-employer scheme.
It seems likely the rationale for employer's consent being required by legislation is because GMP
conversion could impact on the liabilities of the scheme. On this basis it is suggested the pragmatic
approach would be for those employers responsible for funding the scheme under legislation to
consent to the conversion. Schemes may wish to take legal advice on this point.
3.10. Contingent spouses’ pensions
Where a scheme converts GMPs it needs to provide a prescribed minimum level of contingent
survivors' pension to the member's widow/widower or surviving civil partner. It has been pointed
out to the DWP this requirement can result in a materially higher level of survivor pension than pre
conversion for certain schemes (for example where the death in deferment survivors' pension is the
GMP minimum).
Schemes wishing to achieve GMP Equality through conversion will need to make sure they provide
at least the minimum level of survivors' pension post conversion and should also consider the
impact of conversion on the amount of any survivor's pension.
20 Such as the requirement to notify HMRC when a member's benefit is converted and the requirement that an actuarial
certificate expires after three months

4. Section C – Common unanswered issues
4.1 Transfers In
Where a scheme has received a transfer payment in respect of a member it will have provided the
member with additional benefits. The type of additional benefits provided will vary between
schemes and possibly between members within the same scheme. For example, under a defined
benefit scheme an individual may have been granted:
• an additional amount of pension (often a specified amount at retirement date)
• a service credit of additional years, or
• benefits which mirror those provided under the transferring scheme (this tends to be
common on bulk transfers).
Where the transfer included a GMP and the receiving scheme was a contracted-out salary related
scheme (COSR) it will have replicated the GMP and agreed a revaluation basis in line with the
receiving scheme's policy. Similarly, if the transfer payment included protected rights21 then these
will have been converted into a GMP by the receiving scheme.
A transfer in may have been received as a result of:
• an individual transfer – where a member requested a transfer value be paid from the
transferring scheme to the receiving scheme, usually following a change of employment;
or
• a bulk transfer - under which the assets and liabilities relating to a class of members
transferred from the transferring scheme to the receiving scheme often without member
consent (this typically happens as part of a scheme merger or following the sale of part of
a business or corporate group).
Different considerations will apply in each of these scenarios. These are considered below.
4.2. Individual transfers in
European law requires where an individual transfers their pension rights from one occupational
pension scheme to another, the receiving scheme must, on the worker reaching retirement age,
increase the benefits it undertook to pay to the member when accepting the transfer so as to
eliminate ‘the effects of any inadequacy in the amount transferred’ arising from a breach of an
individual's right to equal pay….where those benefits relate to periods of service post 17 May 199022.
This position was accepted by all parties in the Lloyds Bank case23.
It is understood the next instalment of the Lloyds Bank case will be concerned with the position
regarding transfers out and whether the transferring scheme adequately discharged its obligations.
21 Protected rights were contracted out rights accrued under contracted out money purchase schemes
22 See Coloroll Pension Trustees Ltd v Russell
23 See paras 467 and 468 of the first judgment in Lloyds Bank case
17 |


## Page 23

The hearing will not consider the specifics of transferred in benefits. There is however a possibility
the judgment, when issued, may say something about transfers impacting (perhaps indirectly) on
the analysis set out below.
Where a scheme has accepted a transfer payment from a contracted-out scheme, which included
a GMP accrued between 17 May 1990 and 05 April 1997, it may be under an obligation to increase
the member's benefits to reflect any inequality in the transfer value. On the other hand, there may
be no need to increase the member's benefits because the member could have been in the
advantaged category in the transferring scheme (so the transfer value would not have been higher
had they been of the opposite sex24).
The problem in practice is to establish whether any obligation to adjust a transfer in exists and, if so,
to what extent, the receiving scheme would need to have detailed information about the benefit
structure of the transferring scheme, how the original transfer value was calculated and the extent
to which the transfer payment related to post 17 May 1990 pensionable service under the
transferring scheme. In most cases receiving schemes are unlikely to have access to such detailed
information.
On the basis the obligation on a receiving scheme to adjust an individual's transferred in benefits
only arises where it can be shown the original transfer value is inadequate and a receiving scheme
will not be in a position to determine this, the onus will be on affected members to establish this. In
most cases, this will require an affected member to contact and request the transferring scheme:
• calculates whether or not the original transfer payment was inadequate, or
• provides the member with sufficient information to enable the adequacy of the
original transfer payment to be assessed.
Where the adequacy of the original transfer payment cannot be determined (for example, because
the transferring scheme no longer exists or it no longer has the relevant data), the receiving scheme
cannot be sure whether it needs to adjust the member's benefits and if so by how much. In such
situations there is stalemate and the receiving scheme cannot adjust the transferred in benefits to
reflect any inequality in the original transfer value.
Nevertheless, trustees should consider taking preparatory steps so that they are in a position to
take action when the outcome of the Lloyds Bank proceedings is known. These include:
• identifying any members granted benefits under the scheme as a result of a transfer
in where the transfer included a GMP in respect of service between 17 May 1990
and 5 April 1997,
• identifying the schemes from which historic transfer payments have been received
and perhaps carrying out an initial check to see whether they still exist or have
merged, and
24 Ignoring the use of sex based transfer value factors which are permitted
18 |


## Page 24

• locating any documents relating to transfers in and reviewing them to check
whether a discharge and/or an indemnity was granted to the transferring scheme
by the member and/or the receiving scheme.
There is also uncertainty as to whether schemes which accepted a transfer in need to equalise the
benefits provided in respect of that transfer when they come into payment. The member will have
been credited with a GMP as part of the transfer and that GMP would have been different had the
member been of the opposite sex. It is suggested as the Coloroll case refers only to making good
any shortfall in the transfer value received there is no need for a scheme to make any additional
adjustment to transferred in benefits when they come into payment (except to reflect any shortfall
in the quantum of the transfer value received). This relies on an analysis the benefits provided as a
result of a transfer in are not attributable to pensionable service in the receiving scheme (a view
arguably supported by a recent High Court case concerning PPF benefits25).
In some cases, such as on wind up, a scheme may wish to adopt a pragmatic approach and make
a broad-brush adjustment to transferred in benefits. Legal advice should be taken as such
approaches may themselves raise the spectre of discrimination.
4.3. Bulk transfers in
Bulk transfers could be considered to be different to individual transfers when it comes to GMP
Equality. On a bulk transfer, the receiving scheme would normally grant benefits to members by
reference to their accrued rights (or the value thereof) in the transferring scheme26. This differs from
individual transfers where the additional benefit would be calculated by reference to the value of
the assets transferred27. It is suggested a receiving scheme is likely to have an obligation to correct
past GMP inequalities in the transferring scheme where a member has been bulk transferred in.
With bulk transfer cases it is more likely detailed membership data will have passed between the
transferring scheme and the receiving scheme as part of the transfer. Where this is the case the
receiving scheme may be in a position to calculate any GMP Equality increase which should be
applied to each member's benefits without needing to obtain any further information from the
transferring scheme. Where accurate data is not available schemes may decide, having taken
actuarial advice, to adjust bulk transferred in benefits using an estimate of what might have been
the inequality in the transferring scheme.
Schemes might also want to review any legal agreements entered into as part of the bulk transfer
(whether they be scheme merger agreements or commercial agreements entered into by
employers as part of a business sale) as these may contain indemnities which may, subject to any
time limits, cover some or all of the additional liabilities and costs arising as a result of implementing
GMP Equality.
25 Beaton v PPF (2018)
26 Most bulk transfers (such as scheme mergers) will have been on the basis members were provided with mirror image
benefits under the receiving scheme
27 Indeed some bulk transfers would have included assets which were thought to be surplus at the time
19 |


## Page 25

4.4. Split Normal Retirement Ages
Most schemes will have taken steps to equalise their NRAs at some point between 1990 and 1997.
This means there will be tranches of a member's benefit payable by reference to different
retirement ages – with the disadvantaged sex (normally the males) being ‘levelled up’ for the period
17 May 1990 to the date of equalisation.
For example, a scheme which previously had retirement ages of 60 for females and 65 for males
may have equalised retirement ages at 65 on 01 April 1993. Members with pre 1993 pensionable
service will therefore have tranches of benefits with NRAs as follows:
17 May 1990 to 31
Pre 17 May 1990 01 April 1993 onwards
March 1993
Female 60 60 65
Male 65 60 65
These split NRAs further complicate the GMP Equality process both for conversion valuation
purposes and in operating a year by year approach. Indeed, in the table above the male's overall
benefit for the period 01 April 1993 to 05 April 1997 might have a lower actuarial value compared to
the female Comparator because of her higher GMP but then the value of his benefit accrued in the
period 17 May 1990 to 01 April 1993 may have a higher actuarial value than the Comparator.
GMP Equality should be applied to the aggregate of the benefit tranches accrued between 1990
and 1997 – so where values switch between the member and the Comparator between tranches
there can be netting off.
4.5. Revaluation and anti-franking
GMP legislation contains complex rules (known as anti-franking) designed to make sure the
revaluation provided to GMPs in deferment cannot be offset against a member's other benefits. In
broad terms, this can result in pensions in payment being stepped up when a member reaches their
GMP Age. The legislation also requires a later earnings addition (LEA) to be applied where a
member remains in active pensionable service after their GMP Age.
In practice, schemes and their administrators adopt different methods for testing anti-franking and
formal scheme rules rarely go into detail on the subject. When comparing benefits as part of an
equalisation project this will usually be done on the basis of past practice. It is suggested it should
be assumed past practice will continue, unless determined otherwise.
As most members leave service or retire before GMP Age the LEA would not apply to them.
However, when testing for GMP Equality for male members who left or retired after age 60 there is
a need to apply an LEA adjustment to the Comparator's benefit. In practice the data may not be
available to make an accurate LEA adjustment (as it depends on salary increases after age 60).
Schemes may therefore need to adopt a reasonable salary increase assumption.
20 |

|  |  |  |  |  | March 1993 |  |  |

## Page 26

Where GMP Equality is to be achieved through conversion of GMPs the statutory anti-franking rules
will cease to apply for the future. Instead, the actuarial value of any step ups will need to be
factored into the actuarial valuation forming part of the conversion process.
Where a year by year approach is to be adopted for the future, and also when testing pensions
already in payment for past inequality, schemes will need to make an allowance for anti-franking.
One method to test for anti-franking is to:
• Comply with legislation and apply the anti-franking test to the member's whole benefit at
the member's GMP Age or later date of leaving service.
• Compare the benefit of the member relating to service in the period 1990 to 1997 (including
relevant anti-franking and revaluation for the member's sex) with that which would have
been payable to the Comparator in respect of the same period (applying anti-franking and
revaluation for the opposite sex). If the Comparator would have a higher benefit then an
uplift would need to be provided to the member.
4.6. Survivors’ pensions
Following the death of a member who was entitled to a GMP, schemes need to provide, as a
minimum, a survivor's GMP to any legal widow/widower/civil partner28 of the member. In practice
most schemes provide spouse's pensions higher than the GMP minimum and also provide pensions
to children and to financial dependants where there is no legal spouse. Child and dependant
pensions do not include any GMP element, although their calculation is often dependent on the
member's benefit (including the member's GMP).
Survivors' pensions raise a number of issues to be considered when undertaking a GMP Equality
exercise.
a) For survivors' pensions in payment at the date of the equalisation project there would be a
need to consider whether the pension would have been higher had the member's pension
been equalised (assuming the member had pensionable service in the relevant period). If
the member's pension would have been higher at the date of death, then the survivor's
pension at the start would likewise have been higher.
b) In Crossover cases, where the scheme uses a cumulative year by year method for
correcting the past (see Section 2.4), a member's post equalisation pension could have been
lower at the date of death (i.e. at position ‘x’ in the chart in Section 2.4). Depending on the
scheme's specific rules, it may be the survivor's pension should have started at a lower level
(reflecting the lower member's equalised pension). In such cases credit may be taken for
cumulative past ‘overpayments’ to the survivor (with interest). However, it is suggested any
past ‘overpayments’ paid to a member before death cannot be used to reduce a survivor's
own entitlement.
28 In this note reference to a surviving spouse means legal widow/widower/civil partner or same sex married survivor
21 |


## Page 27

c) Once in payment (and unless converted) a legal spouse's pension will contain a survivor's
GMP (broadly 50% of the member's GMP for the relevant period). Depending on how the
scheme increases elements of the survivor's pension there could be inequality after the
spouse's pension comes into payment (comparing the spouse with a notional spouse of the
opposite sex). It is suggested schemes operating a year by year approach do checks on
spouses' pensions in payment and equalise them, where appropriate.
d) Survivors' pensions paid to children or dependants do not contain a GMP so the issue in (c)
should not arise unless administrative practice is to treat part of the pension as ‘notional’
GMP for increase purposes.
4.7. Defined Contribution accounts and cash balance schemes with GMP underpins
Some schemes were set up largely to provide defined contribution (money purchase) or cash
balance benefits but were contracted out on a salary related basis, and include members with GMP
entitlements. These schemes need to provide the member with a pension which at least equals
their GMP (and any post 1997 accrual). Such schemes are referred to in this Guidance Note as ‘GMP
Underpin DC Schemes’ and whilst not directly addressed in the Lloyds Bank judgement will need
to achieve GMP Equality.
Following the logic of the Lloyds Bank case, male members in GMP Underpin DC Schemes will be
disadvantaged compared to their Comparator because a female would have accrued a higher GMP,
payable from an earlier age, than the male. However, it is also possible a female member could be
disadvantaged if her Comparator's GMP at 65 would cross over to become higher than her GMP (for
example because of five additional years of fixed rate revaluation). Females with higher GMPs may
also have had their options restricted at retirement in a way which would not have applied to males
with lower GMPs.
4.8 Transfers from GMP Underpin DC Schemes
Where a member of a GMP Underpin DC Scheme requests a transfer value it is necessary to test
the fund value against the actuarial value of the GMP underpin. Where the value of the GMP
underpin exceeds the member's fund value it is necessary for the scheme to top up the shortfall
before paying the transfer. GMP Underpin DC Schemes should consider adjusting the way transfer
values are calculated in the future to make sure the transfer value is tested against a GMP underpin
which has been equalised. Actuarial and legal advice will be needed.
The position in respect of transfers already paid from GMP Underpin DC Schemes is similar to other
schemes needing to implement GMP Equality. In the case of a GMP Underpin DC Scheme it is
possible the transfer might have been higher had the scheme tested the member's fund against an
equalised GMP underpin at the time of the transfer, sometimes to a significant extent. In other cases
there may be no impact even if the value of the underpin has increased. As mentioned earlier in
this Guidance Note, transfers out are expected to be considered by the Court in the next instalment
22 |


## Page 28

of the Lloyds Bank case. Therefore, schemes may wish to await the outcome of this hearing before
deciding whether or not to revisit historic transfers out.
4.9. Benefits provided by a GMP Underpin DC Scheme
Going forwards, GMP Underpin DC Schemes will need to consider what to do where a member
wishes to draw benefits without taking a transfer value. Typically, this will be at retirement (or earlier
death) and involve the purchase of annuities or securing a pension in the scheme itself. Similar
issues arise to those for more typical schemes, but the impact can be much more significant given
the GMP (or Comparator GMP) may for some members be their full entitlement.
A number of issues arise such as:
Lack of opportunity cases
These are likely to be more pronounced under a GMP Underpin DC Scheme where the value of the
member's fund is below the underpin value. For example:
• Can a GMP Underpin DC Scheme prevent a male member taking benefits at age 60 where
a female would have a right to receive her GMP and his pot would not cover the cost of
providing his benefits?
• Could a female member take a higher commutation payment in circumstances where her
Comparator GMP would be lower than her actual sex GMP?
• Must a member's ability to take a lump sum be restricted so that the remaining pot at least
secures the Comparator's GMP if higher than the actual sex GMP?
Quantum of pension
It is suggested on retirement a GMP Underpin DC Scheme would need to secure benefits in the
form of a pension which at least covers the higher of the member's own GMP entitlement and the
entitlement adjusted to take into account the Comparator's GMP. However, would this be the case
even if the member's pot value exceeded their own sex GMP and could the value in excess of the
own sex GMP be used to provide a more flexible benefit (including a lump sum)?
Applicable DC Fund
Many GMP Underpin DC Schemes compare the GMP underpin against the part of the member's
fund relating to contributions paid up to 05 April 1997. It is considered there is no need to attempt
to sub-divide the member's fund (and GMP underpin) further to seek to identify the part relating to
17 May 1990 to 05 April 1997 (noting this may be impossible in practice). Instead, it is suggested the
member's total GMP underpin (including any adjustment to post 1990 GMP to achieve GMP
Equality) should be compared to the whole of the member's pre 1997 fund.
Securing benefits
Current experience is insurers are unlikely to be willing to insure pension payments on a year on
year GMP Equality basis where there may (or may not) be a cross over at a later date. They are also
likely to insist on any pension at least covering a member’s statutory GMP. Where pensions are
23 |


## Page 29

secured in the scheme the issues are likely to be similar to those arising for more typical defined
benefit arrangements.
4.10. GMP conversion
Given these issues, GMP Underpin DC Schemes may well want to implement GMP Equality through
a conversion process. The existing GMP underpin would be replaced by a new underpin of no less
actuarial value than the equalised GMP. The new underpin would need to be defined benefit in
nature (as required by the conversion legislation) but it could be more flexible (and more attractive
to insurers) than the existing GMP underpin. The replacement underpin could also allow members
the option to access DC style benefits instead at retirement – although the defined benefit underpin
pension would appear to remain the default option.
4.11. Where benefits are already in payment
Finally, GMP Underpin DC Schemes will need to consider what to do for those members who have
already retired (or where the member died before retirement and a spouse’s pension is in payment).
In principle, the considerations are similar to more typical defined benefit schemes, with regard to
lack of opportunity and in relation to member options such as cash commutation. Particular points
to note are:
• It would appear necessary to revisit the original calculations to establish what, if any effect
allowing for the Comparator’s GMP would have had on the retirement calculations.
• There could be a variety of circumstances depending on whether or not the GMP underpin
had applied at retirement. For example, there will be cases where the member's fund
exceeded their GMP and they took a cash lump sum out of the excess, but payment might
not have been permitted had the member's GMP been based on the Comparator's GMP.
• It may not be possible to revisit those individual policies to make any modest improvements
required for GMP Equality (indeed, some insurers may no longer be accepting premiums).
4.12. Divorce cases
Schemes will have dealt with Court orders following the divorce of a member. These orders could
either require pension earmarking or pension sharing with the former spouse. The value of a
member's pension would usually be included as an asset for the purposes of dividing the
matrimonial assets.
Where the member had pensionable service in the period 17 May 1990 and 05 April 1997 there may
be a need to revisit the earmarking or pension sharing order as modest changes may be required
to correct GMP inequalities. In practice much may depend on the specific wording of the relevant
Court Order. It is not clear to what extent this would then require a reopening of the original division
of matrimonial assets.
24 |


## Page 30

Following a divorce a member's benefits would have been reduced to reflect the benefits provided
to the former spouse. This reduction may have reduced the member's GMP (including the part of
the GMP accrued during the period 1990 to 1997). When a scheme is implementing GMP Equality
it should consider how to reflect the member's reduced GMP in the calculation of any equalisation
adjustment and the correction of any past underpayment.
4.13. Top up schemes
There are some ‘top up’ schemes providing benefits (usually for executives and high earners) in
excess of those provided to the member under the main scheme. The top up scheme would not
be contracted out where the main scheme was already contracted out.
It might be thought top up schemes are exempt from the need to think about GMP equalisation.
However, this may not be the case. For example, if a member's benefit is increased under the main
scheme as a result of GMP Equality is it necessary to reduce the pension in payment under the top
up scheme to reflect the increase? If no adjustment is made it is arguable members of the top up
scheme of the opposite sex have been discriminated against.
4.14. Female members with no GMP
There is a category of married (or widowed) women who may have elected to pay National
Insurance Contributions (NICs) at a lower rate than others. Such women who were members of a
contracted out scheme would have no GMP for periods of pensionable service when they paid
reduced NICs.
It is suggested such women are a special category and their benefits do not need to be adjusted
as part of any equalisation project (assuming they have no GMP relating to post 17 May 1990
service). It is also suggested male members cannot point to a reduced rate NICs woman as a
Comparator for GMP Equality purposes – rather the Comparator for a male member is a female
member who paid full rate NICs.
It is also possible a female member joined a scheme after age 60 and therefore has no GMP in
respect of her service (as it was after her GMP age). Such cases are likely to be rare and it is
suggested her opposite sex Comparator for GMP equalisation purposes would be a male joining at
the same age and therefore accruing a GMP.
4.15. Other unanswered questions
Given the many different types of pension schemes and their individual benefit structures there
may be further unanswered questions arising for particular schemes or groups of schemes.
The Group is keen to hear examples of other unanswered questions schemes may encounter.
Suggested approaches to new unanswered questions might be included in updates to this
Guidance Note, where appropriate.

APPENDIX - WORKED EXAMPLES
1. Introduction
These worked examples have been prepared to demonstrate the various methods which could be
adopted to achieve GMP equalisation. They demonstrate how GMP equalisation could be achieved
for an example male member, using a year by year approach or by applying GMP conversion.
The example scheme is a contracted out defined benefit scheme with a NRA of 65 although
members may, with trustee consent, take pensions unreduced from age 62. In deferment, pensions
in excess of GMP are revalued in line with statutory revaluation and GMPs are revalued at the fixed
rate. If a male member's benefit comes into payment before age 65 the scheme revalues the GMP
up to the date of payment at the fixed rate even though, strictly, the GMP does not come into
payment until 6529. Pensions in payment are increased on 01 May each year in line with RPI capped
at 5% but from GMP age the GMP element is increased on the same date to reflect statutory
increases to GMPs.
The example male ‘Mark’ was born on 30 July 1944 and joined the scheme on 01 January 1978 (prior
to GMPs being introduced). Mark continued in pensionable service until 01 January 2000 at which
point his accrued pension was £17,500. Had Mark been female (during all periods of service) the
pension at the date of leaving would also have been £17,500 but the elements making up the
pension would have been different as set out in the table below:
Actual Member Opposite Sex
Pre 88 GMP £2,295.80 £2,732.08
Post 88 GMP £1,496.56 £1,785.68
Pre 1997 Excess £11,529.67 £10,804.27
Post 1997 Excess £2,177.97 £2,177.97
Total £17,500.00 £17,500.00
For GMP Equality it is only the pension accrued during the period 17 May 1990 to 05 April 1997
needing to be adjusted.
29 Individual scheme practice may well differ

| Post 1997 Excess | £2,177.97 |  |

2. Isolating the 1990-1997 Benefits
Mark had pensionable service both before May 1990 and after April 1997 – no adjustment is needed
to his benefits for these two periods. It is therefore necessary to isolate the benefit Mark earned
between 17 May 1990 and 05 April 1997 (both GMP and Excess). This is done by:
a) Pro rating his pre-1997 pension at date of leaving (£15,322.03) to reflect pension earned in
the period 1990/97 on a straight-line basis30. In this example, 35.76% of Mark's pre-1997
service relates to the period post 17 May 1990 – producing a total 90/97 pension at date of
leaving of £5,478.64.
b) Unless accurate data is available it is suggested the GMP accrued to Mark during the period
1990/97 should also be calculated on a pro rata basis. 76.5% of Mark's service over the
period in which his Post 88 GMP accrued relates to post 17 May 1990 service. This produces
a 1990/97 GMP of £1,153.8831.
This means Mark's 1990/97 benefits, at the date of leaving (DOL) pensionable service, and those of
his opposite sex Comparator would be:
90/97 element at DOL Actual Member Comparator
GMP 90/97 £1,153.88 £1,375.92
90/97 Excess £4,324.76 £4,102.72
Total for 90/97 £5,478.64 £5,478.64
3. Worked example 1 – early payment at 62
In this example Mark elected, with trustee consent, to start taking his deferred pension unreduced
from 30 July 2006 (his 62nd birthday). He did not take a lump sum commutation payment and his
revalued pension in the year it came into payment (unequalised) was £21,398.35. As the pension
was not reduced when it came into payment early (as an alternative to his short service benefit),
there was no need to perform an anti-franking test at age 6532.
Between the date of leaving pensionable service, 1 January 2000, and 30 July 2006 Mark's pension
will have been revalued (the GMP at the fixed rate of 6.25% and the excess in line with statutory
revaluation, broadly then RPI capped at 5%). Had Mark been of the opposite sex during that period
revaluation would have been applied to the different figures in the table above (together with the
GMP being revalued to 60 rather than 62 with the inclusion of a late retirement factor) so that as at
age 62 there would be inequality in amounts, namely:
30 The calculation becomes more complex if there have been changes in benefit structures, transfers in or period of part
time service. Most schemes will have equalised normal retirement ages in the period 1990 to 1997 requiring additional pro-
rating. See Section 4.4 of the Guidance Note
31 It is recognised GMPs did not uniformly accrue and are more like a career average benefit but a pro rata approach may
be the only way to isolate 1990/97 GMP – the differences are likely to be small in practice
32 It is assumed the value of the unreduced early pension brought into payment was higher than the value of pension at 65
allowing for anti-franking

The tables above show at all times, Mark was disadvantaged compared to his Comparator. As Mark
has not been a crossover member there is no difference between the various year by year methods
used to calculate past payments. As at 30 April 2020 the total amount of underpaid pension would
be £3,395.92. As the Scheme has no limitation rule this amount (together with interest) would need
to be paid to Mark to compensate him for past GMP inequalities.
The correction of past payments needs to be made whether or not the Scheme adopts a year by
year method or GMP conversion to equalise benefits from May 2020.
Correcting future payments – year by year methods
Were the scheme to adopt a year by year method of GMP equalisation from 01 May 2020, Mark
would be expected33 at all times to receive a higher pension than his pre GMP equalisation pension.
33 The year by year worked examples use actual RPI/CPI to 2019 and assume 3% pa increases on excess and 2% pa on GMP
post 2019

As he would not become a crossover member there is no difference in whether the Scheme uses
a straight year by year or a cumulative method of calculation.
Using a year by year method, Mark's pension would be increased from 01 May 2020 so that his
equalised pension would be £30,542.07 (being the Comparator's amount).
Going forward Mark's pension on a year by year basis would then be as follows:

Assuming Mark lives to the age of 90 the total pension he would have received, pre GMP
equalisation would be expected to be £902,837.46. Applying GMP equalisation on a year by year
basis would result in Mark receiving an extra £8,206.25 over the period of his retirement (an
increase overall of 0.91%).
Correcting for the future – GMP conversion34
Were the Scheme to adopt GMP conversion35 to equalise future payments using 01 May 2020 as
the date when conversion will be implemented, Mark's pension (and his Comparator’s) on the
conversion/equalisation date of 01 May 2020 (after the annual increase but pre-equalisation), would
comprise the following elements:

A GMP equalisation uplift of £284 would need to be added to Mark's pension at 1 May 2020 as he is
disadvantaged at that point, bringing his corrected pension to £30,542. For Mark (as a non-crossover

member) this increase would apply regardless of whether the scheme was using Methods B, C1 or
C2.
There are a number of ways in which GMP conversion could be structured36 and three possibilities
are discussed below37.
a) Convert all the Pre97 benefits into a single tranche of pension.
This approach has the advantage of being simple to calculate and administer but could
involve significant reshaping of members' benefits. Using this approach, the Scheme could
decide to convert all of Mark's Pre 97 benefits into a single tranche of pension, in this
example non-increasing38. Pre-conversion about 87% of Mark’s benefit was increasing and
making all of the pre-97 tranche non-increasing reduces this proportion to about 10% of the
total. It is expected schemes would want to consider whether such a material change in
the nature of the benefit is consistent with their responsibilities and within the scope of the
conversion legislation, particularly since conversion can take place without member
consent.
The actuarial value of Mark's Pre-97 pension (pre-equalisation) is £576,753. As Mark is
disadvantaged, a GMP equalisation uplift with an actuarial value of £5,647 needs to be
added.
Based on assumptions adopted by the trustees, post conversion Mark's Pre-97 pension
would be £33,493 pa. His pension post conversion (both pre and post 97 elements) over the
next five years would then be expected to be as follows:
Year Pre 97 Level Post 97 Total
2020 £33,698 £3,812 £37,510
2021 £33,698 £3,926 £37,625
2022 £33,698 £4,044 £37,743
2023 £33,698 £4,166 £37,864
2024 £33,698 £4,291 £37,989
Under this approach Mark initially receives a significant uplift of £6,968 to his pension as a
result of the conversion when compared with the year by year approach. It is not clear at
the moment how such a significant increase to a pension in payment would be treated for
pension tax purposes. It is expected that HMRC guidance will cover this point when issued.
The expectation is that after year 2029 Mark's pension in payment would dip below the
pension he would have received under the year by year approach but at that point he would
36 Subject to the statutory requirements pensions in payment cannot be reduced at the point of conversion and the need
to provide a contingent spouse's pension
37 It is unclear whether the legislation allows post 1997 benefits to be modified as part of GMP conversion – the examples
leave post 1997 benefits unamended
38 It would be possible to apply future increases to the whole of this tranche. However, as the pre 88 GMP element does
not increase and conversion does not allow pensions in payment to be reduced at the point of conversion scope for
indexation is limited

have received significantly more income over the previous nine years. After 2029 Mark's
converted pension is less able to keep pace with rises in the cost of living, relative to the
year by year approach pension.
b) Convert the Pre 97 benefits into two tranches of benefits
This approach is not as easy to calculate or administer as the first approach but is still fairly
simple and retains a level of future Pre 97 pension increases39 whilst reducing the
immediate step change in the member's pension. It involves converting the member's
pension into a new pension initially the same as (or close to) the year by year adjusted
pension but then redistributes the elements of Pre 97 pension between two tranches with
different pension increases and the overall value is equal to the value of the equalised
pension. Because Mark’s Pre 97 excess pension increases at a different rate to his Post-88
GMP, if it is considered desirable to gain some benefit simplification by only applying one
rate of increase, it is not possible for the post conversion pension to exactly reproduce the
pre conversion equalised payment.
Assuming Mark's scheme retains 5%/RPI increases on one tranche (as previously applied
for Pre 97 Excess and as applies to Mark's Post 97 pension) and makes the second Pre 97
tranche non-increasing, Mark would receive the following payments in the five years post
conversion:
Year Pre 97 Level Pre 97 increasing Post 97 Total
2020 £5,348 £21,391 £3,812 £30,551
2021 £5,348 £22,033 £3,926 £31,307
2022 £5,348 £22,694 £4,044 £32,086
2023 £5,348 £23,375 £4,166 £32,888
2024 £5,348 £24,076 £4,291 £33,714
Under this approach Mark initially receives an uplift of just £9 to his pension as a result of
the conversion when compared with the year by year approach. The expectation is,
although Mark’s pension starts off slightly higher, it will dip slightly below the year on year
pension after three years because a lower proportion is receiving increases. However, the
converted pension is never (according to the assumptions used) more than £20 per annum
less than the year on year pension and the effect of having higher increases overall means
that, eventually (by 2035 in this example), it will result in a higher pension.

c) Keep the shape of the Pre 97 benefits broadly similar to that before conversion
This approach largely forgoes the possibility of simplifying the administration of the
scheme, but results in a pension similar to the pension prior to conversion. It involves re-
shaping the member's 90-97 pension to be the same as the (higher valued) Comparator.
Were the scheme to adopt this approach it would re-characterise Mark's pension into a
‘Notional GMP’ and an ‘Excess’. The Notional GMP (both pre and post 88 elements) would
behave in the same way as a GMP would have done pre conversion but because it is no
longer a formal GMP the statutory provisions no longer apply.
Mark is a disadvantaged non-crossover member so, as part of GMP conversion, the
administrator would adjust Mark's membership record to reflect the Opposite Sex 90/97
GMP and Opposite Sex Pre 97 Excess as at 01 May 2020 (post annual increase but pre
equalisation), as shown below. The table also shows Mark's pre 1990 GMP as this would
need to be converted.

2029 £3,962 £ 4,271 £30,017.61 £38,251
The net effect is to provide Mark with a pension at conversion expected to mirror the
pension which he would have received under the year by year approach. However, as there
has been a formal conversion of the GMP there is no longer any need to monitor the effect
of future pension increases on the Comparator and Mark’s unequalised entitlements (unlike
with a year by year method) even if the future assumed rates of increase are not borne out.

Whilst for Mark (who is over his GMP Age and is not a crossover member) his pension after
conversion would mirror that expected under a year by year approach, for members who
are below GMP age (either actual sex or Comparator) or who have been, or are predicted to
become, crossover members. There would need to be adjustments to reflect anticipated
step ups or downs or past overpayments compared to the Comparator – noting the pension
at the point of conversion cannot be lower than in payment before conversion.
4. Worked example 2 – retirement from active status
Whilst Mark was disadvantaged throughout in Example 1 (early payment at 62) this would not
always be the case as demonstrated by this second example.
In this example, Mark retired from active membership on 01 January 2000 (at the age of 55) and
took an immediate, unreduced, early retirement pension of £17,500. As with Example 1 there was
no lump sum commutation payment.
a) Payments January 2000 to May 2005
There would have been no difference between Mark's pension and his Comparator’s until the
increase granted on 01 May 2005. Before the 01 May 2005 increase date Mark's pension would
have been £18,715.88 which would be the same as his Comparator's. However, the Comparator
reached the opposite sex GMP Age (60) on 01 January 2005 so the Comparator's GMP would
have come into payment (revalued40).
b) May 2005 increase
After GMP Age the scheme increases GMPs at a different rate to excess benefits and uses
different reference dates for indexes. For 2005 the increase rate was 3.2% for non GMPs41 and
3% for (post 88) GMPs42.
As Mark was below his (own sex) GMP Age on 01 May 2005 the scheme increased the whole of
his pension by 3.2% to £19,311.28. However, the Comparator's pension would have been
increased by less because the Comparator's 90-97 GMP element would have been increased
at the lower rate of 3.0%.
Immediately following the 01 May 2005 increase the pension of Mark and his Comparator would
be:
01/5/2005 – Pre 90 Pre 88 88-90 90-97 90-97
Post 97 Total
30/4/2006 Excess GMP GMP Excess GMP

Comparator £10,864.17 £0 £0 £4,237.24 £1,806.04 £2,403.83 £19,311.28
As can be seen, the differences would very small with Mark receiving an annual pension which
would have been £3.51 higher than his Comparator.

c) May 2006 increase
The increase rates the scheme applied in 2006 for GMP increases was higher at 2.7% compared
to 2.4% for the excess.
Applying these increases to Mark and the Comparator's elements of pension would have
meant in the period 01 May 2006 to 30 April 2007 Mark received a lower pension than his
Comparator as set out in the table below. The difference over the whole year was £1.83.

d) May 2007 increase
The increase rates for the May 2007 increase were 4.2% for the excess and 3.0% for GMPs. This
would have resulted in Mark becoming advantaged compared to his Comparator by £20.35
over the year as follows:

Comparator £11,592.16 £0 £0 £4,521.17 £1,910.45 £2,564.91 £20,588.68
e) May 2008 increase
The increases applied to the excess element (still the whole of Mark's pension) at May 2008
were 4.1%. Again, the element of the Comparator's pension relating to 90-97 GMP was capped
at 3.0%. Mark remained advantaged by £42.20 over the year as follows:

Comparator £12,067.44 £0 £0 £4,706.53 £1,967.76 £2,670.07 £21,454.00
f) May 2009 increase
Macro-economic factors (the financial crisis) meant the percentage increase applied to the
excess element of Mark's pension on 01 May 2009 was only 0.1% yet the increase the scheme
applied to GMPs was 3.0%. This meant Mark would have, once again, switched to becoming a
disadvantaged member (receiving £14.82 less than his Comparator) as follows:

£12,079.50 £4,711.24 £2,026.80 £2,672.74 £21,490.28
g) July 2009 – GMP Age
Mark reached his own-sex GMP Age (65) in July 2009. Because Mark retired from active
pensionable service there would have been no need to increase Mark's pension in July 2009
as his pension then in payment (£21,475.46) exceeded his GMP of £6,544.20 (revalued to age
65).
h) May 2010 increase
The rates of increase to pensions granted by the scheme in May 2010 were 3.7% for the
excess and 0% for GMPs. Once again Mark would have switched from being disadvantaged
to having a pension which would be £105.57 higher than his Comparator. The pension
elements would have been as follows:
01/5/2010- Pre 90 Pre 88 88-90 90-97 90-97

30/4/2011 Excess GMP GMP Excess GMP

i) Increases after May 2010
At all points after May 2010 Mark, whose 90-97 GMP and 90-97 Excess are both higher than
his Comparator would remain advantaged and there would be no further crossovers in the
future.

5. Achieving equality in worked example 2
When the scheme implements GMP Equality in May 2020 it will need to consider whether Mark's
benefits need to be adjusted for both the past and the future.
a) Past payments
In aggregate Mark would have received £1,227.41 more in pension than his Comparator
over the period January 2000 to 1 May 2020. However, there were two years (2006/07
and 2009/10) when Mark was disadvantaged by a total of £16.65.
If the scheme adopts a cumulative basis for calculating past under payments (Methods C1
or C2) then no compensation is required. However, if Method B approach is adopted to
calculate past underpayments Mark would be due past compensation of £16.65 plus
interest.
b) Correcting future payments
As Mark would be in the advantaged category for the rest of his life there would be no need
to adjust his pension going forwards if the scheme used a year by year approach to achieve
GMP Equality. The scheme might wish to convert Mark's GMP as part of a GMP conversion
exercise and might re-shape his benefits (or not) as part of the exercise.
