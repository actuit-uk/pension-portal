1. Introduction
The Methodology Guidance issued in September 2019 included a short section on anti-franking. Following
requests from the industry, this supplement to that Guidance examines the interaction of anti-franking and
GMP equalisation in more detail, considering why anti-franking is important and suggesting approaches to
deal with key areas of uncertainty. It doesn’t provide a full manual for anti-franking calculations; we
recommend schemes consult the relevant legislation/their legal advisors for the exact requirements.
2. Anti-franking
What is anti-franking?
GMP legislation contains complex rules (known as anti-franking) designed to make sure the revaluation
provided to GMPs in deferment can’t be offset against a member's other benefits (other than in limited
circumstances). This is implemented by means of an ‘anti-franking minimum pension’ defined under
legislation and underpins the scheme pension. In broad terms, this can result in pensions in payment being
stepped up when a member reaches their GMP Age, or at retirement when a member remains in active
pensionable service after their GMP Age.
Anti-franking shouldn’t be confused with the GMP coverage requirement1 for the total pension accrued prior
to 06 April 1997 to be at least equal to the GMP. The coverage requirement applies in a wider variety of
situations than anti-franking, but where anti-franking applies it’ll exceed the coverage requirement.
In practice, schemes and their administrators adopt different methods for testing anti-franking and formal
scheme rules rarely go into detail on the subject. When comparing benefits as part of an equalisation project
this will usually be done on the basis of past practice.
Why does anti-franking matter for GMP equalisation?
Anti-franking only applies directly to certain members2. For many schemes anti-franking may have little
impact on the overall scheme liability or benefits payable for most members. However, for those members
to whom anti-franking does apply, it can have a significant impact – which usually only applies to one sex.
Anti-franking can therefore significantly impact GMP equalisation, including changing which sex is better off
overall (see the difference between the Guy and Gary examples in Appendix 2 for a demonstration). In some
schemes, most of the large uplifts required to achieve GMP Equality will be due to anti-franking.
1 Formerly defined under Regulation 55 of the OPS (Contracting-out) Regulations. This was revoked after 05 April 2016, but should’ve
been included in individual Scheme Rules, so in practice will remain in effect.
2 Anti-franking applies directly to members who leave before NPA and then retire at NPA, and to members who leave active service at
or over NPA, subject to certain additional conditions set out in the Pension Schemes Act 1993 s87. However, the preservation
requirements for members taking early or late retirement to receive benefits at least equal in value to those they would’ve received had
they retired at NPA means it may have an indirect effect on other members as well.

Which schemes will be affected by anti-franking?
Anti-franking legislation will apply to all schemes which need to achieve GMP Equality, although in most cases
the underpin will be unlikely to bite. Members for whom anti-franking is particularly likely to be an issue
include:
• Members with Normal Pension Age (NPA) < 65 where no increases are given on Pre97 excess in
payment
• Members with NPA < 65, where the scheme doesn’t give revaluations on GMP on retirement prior
to GMP age, or where these revaluations are at a lower rate than statutory GMP revaluation
• Members who continue in service past age 60
• Members with high GMP proportions
Note even for schemes where the benefit structure is such that anti-franking uplifts aren’t usually required,
there may still be individual members (typically those with high proportions of GMP, or for whom the Later
Earnings Addition applies) who are due uplifts.
All schemes should therefore consider anti-franking as part of achieving GMP Equality.
3. Key anti-franking issues for GMP equality
Implementation of whole of service test for equalisation of post 90 benefits
Anti-franking is defined under legislation as a whole of service test, with no consideration it might be applied
to only part of a member's benefits. For members who commenced service prior to 17 May 1990, it’s
therefore legislatively unclear how anti-franking should be applied for equalisation purposes. Three potential
techniques are explained below, but other techniques are also possible and have been used within the
industry.
A. Ring-fence (90-97) Technique [See examples Guy, Gary and Edward]
The Methodology Guidance published in September 2019 set out the following technique, which ‘ring-fences’
90-97 benefits:
• Comply with legislation and apply the anti-franking test to the member's whole (unequalised)
benefit at the member's GMP Age or later date of retirement
• Compare the benefit of the member relating to service in the period 1990 to 19973 (including relevant
anti-franking and revaluation for the member's sex to that 1990 to 1997 pension in isolation as if it
were the member’s only benefit) which would’ve been payable to the comparator in respect of the
same period (applying anti-franking and revaluation for the opposite sex to that 1990 to 1997
pension in isolation as if it were the comparator’s only benefit). Where the comparator would have
3 You should carefully consider the extent to which benefits outside the 90-97 period affect the 90-97 benefits. For example, we would
usually expect the NPA used would be consistent with that for the whole Scheme, even though the pension amounts are being
calculated based on 90-97 service only.


## Page 6

a higher benefit an uplift would need to be provided to the member reflecting the difference
between the two
We expect this technique to be the starting point used for discussion for many schemes, as it’s relatively
simple and will often be appropriate; we’ve therefore focused our examples later on this. However, it can
give odd answers in some circumstances4.
Alternative techniques are possible. We set out two below. These also have their own disadvantages
(including typically requiring more data and calculations than the ring-fencing technique) and aren’t intended
to be exhaustive. Appendix 1 sets out a comparison of these techniques to the Ring-Fence Technique.
B. DWP 2012 (Whole of Service Mixed Sex) Technique
The Department for Work and Pensions published examples (7 and 8) in its January 2012 consultation ‘A
possible method for equalising pensions for the effect of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension’5 which included
an anti-franking technique. This worked as follows:
• Comply with legislation and apply the anti-franking test to the member's whole (unequalised)
benefit at the member's GMP Age or later date of retirement
• Compare this total pension to a pension calculated as follows:
o The Pre90 element consists of the member's pension
o The Post90 element consists of the opposite sex's pension
o The anti-franking minimum at each age consists of the sum of the following components:
▪ The Pre90 minimum for the true sex. This will always include the member’s Pre90
pension at cessation date, and any applicable increase in Pre90 excess pension, but
will only include increases on Pre90 GMP if the true sex has reached GMP age
▪ The Post90 minimum for the opposite sex. This will always include the
comparator’s Post90 pension at cessation date, and any applicable increase in
Post90 excess pension, but will only include increases on Post90 GMP if the
comparator has reached GMP age
To adopt this technique a scheme would need to determine how such a ‘mixed sex’ underpin would be
calculated. This isn’t covered by legislation and isn’t completely described in the DWP examples. The chosen
approach would then need to be coded.
C. Apportionment (Whole of Service Pure Sex) Technique
This technique performs the whole of service test, and then attempts to allocate part of the resulting uplift
to the 90-97 period:
4 For example, consider a Scheme where nil pension increases are applied on excess pension accrued after 1 January 1989, but the
Scheme has Fixed 3% increases on Pre89 excess. In this scenario, considering only 90-97 benefits may result in an uplift being due where
no uplift would have been required on the full pension.
5https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/draft-occupational-pension-schemes-and-pension-protection-fund-equality-
amendment-regulations-2012. Note the DWP examples assume the female’s GMP comes into payment immediately following the
Cessation Date, and is therefore not subject to anti-franking; this guidance extrapolates the basic technique to a more general case.


## Page 7

• Comply with legislation and apply the anti-franking test to the member's whole (unequalised)
benefit at the member's GMP Age or later date of retirement
• Apply the anti-franking test to the opposite comparator's whole benefit (including Pre90 pension)
at the comparator's GMP age or later date of retirement
• Pro-rate the anti-franking step-ups in an appropriate manner for the 90-97 period only
• Compare the benefit for a member relating to 90-97 service only, with the member's step-up
calculated in the previous step, with that for the equivalent pension for the comparator. If the
comparator would have a higher benefit then an uplift will need to be provided to the member
To adopt this technique a scheme would need to determine how such pro-rating would be undertaken. This
is not covered by legislation or court judgments. In practice there are several ways the pro-rating of the step-
up could be done. For example, one possible technique is to pro-rate on the GMP at the anti-franking date.
The approach taken could have a material impact on the uplifts members will receive.
The different techniques will have different requirements for the data held to administer the year-by-year
approaches on an ongoing basis. For example, the Ring-fence technique requires you to hold three different
pension streams (whole pension for true sex, true 90-97 and comparator 90-97), whereas the Apportionment
method requires four streams (whole pension for true sex, true 90-97, whole pension for comparator sex
and comparator 90-97). They’ll also require differing amounts of data and calculations to perform the initial
calculations. We therefore recommend you confirm with your current scheme administrator they can
implement your preferred approach, and also consider the implications over the longer term. Future
guidance on Administration of GMP Equalisation will explore in more detail the interaction of multiple
pension streams with administration and payroll systems.
The examples in this Guidance all follow the ‘ring-fencing’ technique.
The later earnings addition, and associated anti-franking elements
The Later Earnings Addition, when combined with the Appropriate Addition and the requirement to give
revaluations and increases on GMP, has the effect of preventing the late retirement factor on GMP from
‘eating into’ the salary increases due on the excess for members who continue in pensionable service after
their Cessation Date6.
For a member who retires from active service, this can typically7 require an uplift to their pension equal to:
GMP @ Cessation Date x (GMP LRF factor between Cessation Date and Date of Leaving – Increase in Final
Pensionable Salary between Cessation Date and Date of Leaving)8
6 Prior to 06 April 1997, “Cessation Date” is a member’s GMP date (for members who do not leave the Scheme prior to this). After
06 April 1997, some Schemes interpret it as GMP date and others as State Pension Date.
7 This makes several simplifying assumptions, including a member's pension definition doesn’t include a State Pension Deduction, and
that the Final Pensionable Salary doesn’t decrease over the period. You should therefore refer directly to the legislation before applying
it to individual schemes
8 This can also be written as: GMP @ Date of Leaving – GMP @ Cessation Date x Final Pensionable Salary @ Date of Leaving / Final Pensionable
Salary @ Cessation Date


## Page 8

This can result in uplifts which are as much as 50% or more of the GMP at Cessation Date, which is significant
for equalisation purposes. The uplift will be higher, the lower the Final Pensionable Salary (FPS) increase. Note
whilst the Later Earnings Addition itself is set to zero where salary increases are nil or negative, the other
anti-franking elements will still combine to give an uplift in these scenarios.
Why is the later earnings addition particularly relevant for anti-franking?
Historically, few women have remained in pensionable service past age 60 and few men have remained past
age 65. This has meant the Later Earnings Addition has been relevant for relatively few members. However,
many men have historically remained in pensionable service past age 60, and under GMP Equalisation the
opposite sex comparators' pensions will be subject to a Later Earnings Addition, which may be of a significant
size.
Examples Guy and Gary in Appendix 2 demonstrate the potential impact.

9 These are examples of situations where frankable elements are created that can be used to reduce any step-up. They’re not intended to be exhaustive.
10 The deferred revaluations on excess pension strictly arise from the revaluation legislation, not the anti-franking legislation. However, as they apply in addition to the anti-franking minimum, they’ve been included
here for simplicity. Some schemes aren’t subject to the revaluation requirements; this doesn’t stop anti-franking from applying, but the minimum above would no longer include excess deferred revaluations.

Note that this gives an anti-franking step-up
rather than the anti-franking minimum given
under the other approaches. It is simple to
convert between the two if you know the
pension immediately prior to GMP age.
There are many situations where all techniques give the same outcome, for example:
• For members where no anti-franking uplift applies under all techniques11
• For members with pensionable service only in the period 1990-1997
Outcomes can differ when ‘frankable’ elements are available from outside of the period 1990-97 e.g. increases on pre 97 excess, pre 78 service, Barber late retirement
factors or where the Scheme franks against Post97 pension increases. All outcomes can give odd results in some circumstances that are a consequence of applying
complicated legislation in a manner never intended.
11 Note it’s possible for members to have no uplift due under one technique but to be due one under another – for example, a member for whom the anti-franking minimum is exceeded by the Scheme pension when
the whole pension is considered, but not when the 90-97 period is considered in isolation, would have an uplift due under the Ring-fence technique but not the DWP 2012 or Apportionment techniques.

Appendix 2 – Examples
Example: Guy – Later Earnings Addition Using Ring-Fence (90-97) Technique
This example is based on a previously issued example (DWP 2012 Example 312). In this example, the anti-franking inequality is established using benefits attributable to 90-
97 in isolation. The calculation is shown from retirement through to 31 December 2020.
The calculation shows, at outset, the opposite sex (female) pension is higher because of the later earnings addition; however, over time, the escalation on the higher true
sex (male) GMP results in no advantage. There’s no advantage to the opposite sex (female), so Guy’s pension in payment does not require an uplift. However, there’s a
very small back payment due if Method B is adopted. The opposite would be the case if the member is the opposite sex female comparator.

15 While the non-GMP has been calculated and is shown, in actual fact this is cosmetic for Guy. The results aren’t sensitive to the amount of non GMP because i) there’s sufficient 90-97 pension to cover the true and
comparator GMP and ii) as a result of the particular scheme design. This highlights the opportunity to side-step the historical data requirement and simplify the calculation by using the ‘Forms’ calculation approach for
cases where the results are a function of just the post 90 GMP (please see the PASA Data guidance for information). This short cut is available on all the PASA examples in this paper (Mark, Guy, Gary and Edward).
However, the short cut isn’t always available – e.g. it wouldn’t be if GMP wasn’t covered; or for cases requiring an anti-franking step-up but increases are paid on pre 97 non GMP.
16 The 2012 DWP Example 3 result included a starting pension LEA difference of £122 in respect of all female GMP rather than £36 in respect of female post 90 GMP. Page 15 reads “the application of the equality rule
means his entitlement is £2,822”, using the calculations here it should read £2,736 (£2,700 plus £36).

Example Gary – As Guy, but 10 years later
This example is based on the previous example for Guy, but Gary is 10 years younger than Guy and all events are 10 years later. The example now shows the impact where the
female comparator no longer ceases to accrue GMP before the male does, as both sexes reach 06 April 1997 before they reach GMP age. With full GMP accrual, the calculation
shows there is now a significant advantage to the opposite sex (female) comparator. This advantage applies from retirement and the advantage increases each year. Hence,
an uplift is required for Gary. This is the same on whichever method is used.

Results for a true sex male
Unlike the previous example of Guy, in Gary’s case, the female comparator would also have earned GMP throughout her pensionable service. Here, the impact of the Later
Earnings Addition in the female comparator is significant. In this case the female comparator’s pension starts significantly ahead of the Guy’s pension, and remains ahead. So,
Guy should receive a pension uplift of £483 pa (a 20% uplift to his pension earned between 17 May 1990 and 05 April 1997) so he is receiving the female comparator’s pension.
Guy would also receive a significant back payment, which would be identical on all Lloyds methods (as at all points from retirement the female comparator has received a
higher pension).
17 Three different approaches to obtaining the true and opposite sex Post 90 GMP were included in the PASA GMP Equalisation Data Guidance, Section C3. In this example, we have used the Pro-Rata approach.
18 GMP Conversion factors were published within Appendix 2 of the PASA GMP Equalisation Data Guidance

Example Edward – Anti-Franking Using Ring-Fence (90-97) Technique
This example is based on a previously issued example (DWP 2012 Example 719) which illustrates different results depending on the approach taken to calculate anti-franking
steps. The calculation solution is presented using benefits attributable to 90-97 in isolation.
The calculation shows there’s no advantage to the opposite sex (female) as at 31/12/2020. At the outset, there’s no difference in pension between the true sex (male) and
opposite sex (female) starting pension. However, after the first increase, the opposite sex (female) pension is higher and a buffer is built up until male GMP payment age. At
this point, the pension advantage is reversed when the true sex (male) steps is applied. Over time, the opposite sex (female) advantage is eroded and then swaps to the true
sex (male).

90-97 True Sex (male) 20 The Ring-fence (90-97) technique treats 90-97 in isolation
90-97 Pension at DOL £2,066 (£2,700 * 6.888/9) of pre 90 and post 97 so that these benefits are
Post 90 GMP at DOL £500 (supplied by NISPI GMP online checker) considered unchanged. Alternative approaches are
Post 90 scheme accrual dates 17/05/1990 – 31/03/1997
possible.
90-97 Pension at DOR £2,066
The DWP example applied a whole of service approach
90-97 Minimum male pension at age 65 £2,268 (2,066 + 500 * 0.403) where 0.403 is from the
and calculated mixed sex steps. This led to a larger male
GMP revaluation factor 1.07^5. Note no increases are
paid on non GMP in this example. step and larger no loss result.
Another way to show this calculation is (500.00 *
1.403 + (2,066-500.00) * 1.000) where 1.403 is the
GMP revaluation factor.
90-97 Opposite sex (female)
90-97 Pension at DOL £2,066
Female post 90 GMP may be obtained using the Pro-Rata approach:
Post 90 GMP (female) at DOL £600 (obtained from the NISPI GMP online checker
but also verifiable using a GMP conversion factor of
1.2)
90-97 Pension at DOR £2,066
Results (for a true sex male)
Difference in pension (Female less Male) at 31/12/2020 -£140
Method B/C1/C2 Change in Pension at 31/12/2020 Nil
Method B back payment at 31/12/2020 £161 plus interest
(this result ignores any instalment where the male received more
than the female)
Accumulated shortfall at 31/12/2020 before interest (i.e. net result of -£2,349
accumulated under- and over- payments)
20 Three different approaches to obtaining the true and opposite sex Post 90 GMP were included in the PASA GMP Equalisation Data Guidance, Section C3. In this example, we suppose the Post 90 True and Post 90
Opposite Sex GMPs are obtained from the NISPI GMP Online Checker (a pro-rata approach would vary slightly).

Edward is a cross-over case. His pension at retirement is the same as that of the female comparator, but the comparator’s GMP increases in payment between 60 and 65, so
the female comparator will have received a higher pension in this period. Edward’s pension receives a step at age 65 at which point the position is reversed.
If we are looking at the position at the end of 2020:
• on Method B there’s no change in his pension – the higher pension is paid
• on Methods C1 or C2 it’s necessary to first consider the accumulated past payments; Edward has received £2,349 more in higher pension payments than his female
comparator (Method C1), equivalent to £2,716 with interest in line with the Lloyds judgment (Method C2). Hence he should continue to receive his own pension on
either Method C1 or C2
This is the case whether or not a limitation period is applied.
If Method B is used (but only on Method B) with no limitation period, Guy would also receive a small lump sum back payment due to the historic cross-over equal to his pension
shortfall up to age 65 plus interest.
Results for a true sex female
If we reversed the genders so we started with a true sex female, then there would be an advantage to the opposite sex (male) and using the same calculation results but
reversing the signs:
Results (for a true sex female)
Method B/C1/C2 Change in Pension at 31/12/2020 Uplift of £140
Method B back payment at 31/12/2020 £2,510 plus interest
(this result ignores any instalment where the female received more
than the male)
On all methods her pension would increase by £140 going forward, an increase of 6% (=£140 / £2,461) on her post 17 May 1990 pension (she is owed money for GMP
equalisation to date whatever limitation period is applied and Guy’s current pension is higher than her own). The female comparator would also receive a back payment,
which would depend on the Method used.

21 No anti-franking test required at age 60 in respect of the opposite sex GMP accrued after 17 May 1990 as there’s no gap between ceasing contracting out employment and that element coming into payment.
22 A step up at 65 is applied using a ring-fence (90-97) anti-franking test (see earlier workings)
